## Description:
A movie recommendation system is a Machine Learning based approach to filtering or predicting the userâ€™s movie preferences based on their past data and behavior.


## Problem Statement:
When the movie recommender system was not designed before that users manually search and find the movies they like based on feedbacks or they choose the movies randomly.This was very time consuming and irritating process to find the intresting movie.
## Solution:
Design a system that shows more similar movies to searched movie.
## Objective:
To design a system (website) that takes user input(movie name) and will recommend five similar movies related to the input movie based on the features like:( cast, crew ,genres etc.) using cosine similar method.
## Requirements:

To run this project, you will need to download the following :

`IDE: jupyternotebook`

`python version : 3.9.12`

`pip version : 21.2.4`

`pycharm version : 23.1.1`

`libraries : mentioned in requirements.txt`


## Task:
- Import Required library
- Importing Dataset
- Data Understanding
- Data Cleaning 
- Creating Tags
- Stemming all the Tags
- Text Vectorization 
- Finding similarities between vectors using Cosine Similarity method
## Conclusion :
Successfully designed a content based movie recommendation system , which recommends  five movies based on the similarities (like:cast,genre,crew etc.) of entered movies by using cosine similarity method.
